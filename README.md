## Overview of Analysis

A surf shop in Oahu needs analytics on weather affecting future business operations. Investors want to make sure that rain will not impact negatively on locals and tourists coming to surf and get ice cream at the shop. I used SQLAlchemy and SQLite to provide resources for the shop owner to show her future investors. Kowabunga!

## Results

We looked at December and June to analyze how peak seasons could be affected by weather. December has a higher chance of rain than June does, while June is of course warmer than December, even in Hawaii. 

## Summary 

This shop is good to go! While December is slightly cooler with more chance of rain than June according to our data, there is not much drastic change year round.
